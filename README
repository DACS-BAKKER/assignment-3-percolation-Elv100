Name: Elven Shum
Project: Percolation Problem Set

Write Up: [IN PROGRESS]

Instructions: 
  To run the percolation simulation, run the main in "Runner.java". This class will print the simulartion's average percolation probability and time taken.
For actual algorithm comparrisons only use Runner.java
Follow the console prompts to initiate correctly. Choosing algorithms, grid size, and repitiion numbers are all handled by the console prompts.


  "RunnerGraphics.java" adds graphics to "Runner.java"
Used for visual understanding of inner proccesses. Don't use to when attempting to compare algorithms becuase graphics will slow algorithms down.


Notes: 
  "UFAlgorithm.java" is an abstract class used for all UF Algorithms.
